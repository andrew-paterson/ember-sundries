## Components

### Animated Accordion

Wraps content in a single accordion. Accordions cannot be grouped.

    {{#ember-sundries/animated-accordion title="Title" open=true toggleWithCss=true}}
      ...Content here
    {{/ember-sundries/animated-accordion}}

#### Options

- `title` - Displays on the accordion header.
- `open` - If true, the accordion will be open to begin with.
- `toggleWithCss` - If true, the content of the accordion will be inserted into the DOM even if then accordion is closed, but the class of `open` will not be given to the accordion, and so the content is hedden by CSS. If not true, the accordion content of removed from the DOM when the accordion is closed.
- `accordionHeaderContent` - The path to a component to display in the header, after the title.
- ` accordionHeaderProps` - Only relevent where `accordionHeaderContent` is used. Accepts a hash of values which are passed to the component specified for `accordionHeaderContent`.
